This is the code for simulating the chiral fluid, all in julia. The code is all run from the running.jl file. 
fornberg.jl contains everything about taking derivatives and remeshing. Works for all 1d pdes
chiral_forn.jl contains the adaptive differential equation solver. Could be adapted to other pdes
running.jl runs everthing.
